    "# Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# It involves the use of various methods, techniques, and tools to gather and analyze data, and to draw conclusions and make predictions based on the results.\n",

    "# The primary goal of statistics is to provide a quantitative understanding of a particular phenomenon, population or system. \n",
